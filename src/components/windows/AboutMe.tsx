    Nice to meet ya! I am a self-taught creative who finds retreat in curiously throwing things together in their free time. Over the last several years I have worked on various projects with my experiences in video editing, graphic design, VFX, and occasionally making music here and there. 
    </p>
  <p className="about-bio" style={{ width: '95%' }}>This site aims to be an archive of some of my best scraps, loosely stitched together in a way that can at least be presentable. Everything seen on here was formed from a collection of flickering synapses and contempt for predictability.

    At the end of the day, I simply just create the stuff that I wish to see and experience. To me that's the only compass that really makes sense.
